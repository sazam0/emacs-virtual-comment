* Intro
This package allows adding virtual comments to files in buffers. These comments
don't belong to the files so they don't. They are saved in project root or a
global file which can be viewed and searched. The file name is =.evc=.

* Demo

* Virtual comments
A virtual comment is an overlay and it is added above the line it comments on
and has the same indentation. The virtual comment can be single line or
multiline. Each line can have one comment.

#+begin_src
(require 'virtual-comment)
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'virtual-comment-mode)
#+end_src

* Commands
- =virtual-comment-make=: create or edit a comment at current line
- =virtual-comment-next=: go to next comment in buffer
- =virtual-comment-previous=: go to previous comment in buffer
- =virtual-comment-delete=: remove the current comment
- =virtual-comment-paste=: paste the last removed comment to current line
- =virtual-comment-realign=: realign the comments if they are misplaced
- =virtual-comment-persist=: manually persist project comments
- =virtual-comment-show=: show all comments of current project in a derived mode
from =outline-mode=, press enter on a comment will call =virtual-comment-go= to go
to the location of comment. =C-c C-d=
(=virtual-comment-show-delete-display-unit-at-point=) will delete that comemt.

There are no default bindings at all for these commands.

* Remarks
- It's very hard to manage overlays. So this mode should be use in a sensible
  way. Only comments of files can be persisted.
- From version =0.4.1= a backup of current data will be made as =.evc.bk= when data
  is persisted
* Test
